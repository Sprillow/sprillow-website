Love. Food. Still, the production and consumption of food in our world is a source of massive issues and inequalities.

There is no such thing as waste, only resources in the wrong place. The Earth is a closed-loop system meaning there is no 'somewhere else', and for that reason it is imperative that we adopt the workings of a 'circular economy'. We aim to support initiatives that accelerate the transition to zero-waste economies, whether through bulk buying strategies, cutting out single-use plastics, or otherwise."}]},"allPortfolioCsv":{"nodes":[{"id":"3567d674-7bd9-5c92-bbc9-0d259b70631b","project":"Acorn","deliverable":"MacOS and Linux App","link":"https://github.com/h-be/acorn-docs"},{"id":"51058185-acb6-5997-9934-e34cd058ea84","project":"Red Cat Bakery","deliverable":"E-commerce Website","link":"https://redcatbakery.com"},{"id":"4d36723d-42b1-556d-b4a8-09762fa90816","project":"Fouladi Projects","deliverable":"E-commerce Website","link":"https://fouladiprojects.com"},{"id":"b32ab80a-4326-5771-b529-b51dd7b657b9","project":"Online Writing Workshop","deliverable":"Marketing Website","link":"https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com"}]}}}
