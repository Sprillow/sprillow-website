app release",https://github.com/lightningrodlabs/acorn,"Modelled playfully after the energetic nature of squirrels, Acorn is a collaborative desktop application for teams and individuals to map their aspirational goals and efforts. We used cutting edge peer-to-peer software Holochain for this project.",Acorn started with a desire to have an alternative workflow to Agile for software development practices. It expanded into a general purpose project management tool and process.,Folks at Harris-Braun Enterprises had a long standing vision for the power of trees as data structures. Sprillow took on the task of designing an application for them that has the subtle potential to disrupt project management workflows.,"The challenge was to take a starting point of complexity and abstractions, and to create a friendly, but still powerful user interface around that.","Through an intuitive icon system, and color scheme, we created a language that is easy to learn that runs through the app. By providing multiple diverse views into the same dataset, we provided users the lenses they need to make the most of their time.",
