              <p className="about-description">
                Pegah loves plants, both as metaphors, and as living things.
                When she's not designing, she's probably researching, watering
                plants, or enjoying some cuisine exploration. Pegah likes wood,
                plants, and anything inspired by nature. She is in her best when
                she listens to nature. The best moments are when her work brings
                thoughtfulness, joy, and inspiration to the people, and respect
                to the environment and humanity. Pegah loves unique things
                created with character and thoughtfulness. She also loves it
                when work of design actually has a positive impact in the world.
                In her design work she brings joy, thoughtfulness, and
                inpiration to its audience and users.

              <p className="about-description">
                Connor is a minimalist. He likes keeping life simple so that he
                can focus on the big and hard puzzles. He is a contemplater,
                with a mind that works overtime on juicy challenges. Sometimes
                they keep him up at night, and then wake him up at 6 in the
                morning and he has to get out of bed and get back to it. With
                people, Connor has a strong diplomatic side, and is able to
                connect with many different people with diverse perspectives and
                make everyone feel heard. Connor adores learning. He is
                currently learning Farsi (Persian) and Spanish. Connor is a
                tinkerer and fixer. He grew up tearing about and putting
                together the raw parts of computers for fun, and was always
                entranced by technology. He is a self-taught developer and
                facilitator.
