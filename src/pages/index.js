                beauty. When she's not designing, she's probably researching,
                watering plants, or enjoying some culinary exploration. Pegah
                loves unique things created with character and thoughtfulness.
                She is at her best when she is inspired by and listens to
                nature. The best moments are when her work brings
                thoughtfulness, joy, and inspiration to people, and is in
                respect of the environment and humanity. */}
                Pegah loves to be in the garden with the plants. She marvels at
                nature, and finds her inspiration there. She believes in the
                saying that we have to "think globally, and act locally",
                because we have to understand the interconnections, and then
                make changes to ourselves and in our communities and workplaces
                that reflect the impacts we all have on each other, and the
                world. Pegah won't let go of the details. She pays meticulous
                attention to things that many people would overlook. Because
                of this Pegah feels a strong connection with the things she touches and sees,
                whether it's her latest design, the clothing she wears, or the
                food she loves to cook. She loves to feel the joy of her designs
                invoking joy, thoughtfulness and inspiration for other people.

                keeping life simple so that he can focus on the macro picture. Connor has a bad habit of over-thinking. He is
                currently learning Farsi (Persian) and Spanish. Connor is a
                tinkerer and fixer. He grew up tearing about and putting
                together the raw parts of computers for fun, and was always
                entranced by technology. He is a self-taught developer and
                facilitator. */}
                Connor is obsessed with seeing the systems that our lives are
                woven into. Economic, environmental, political, and everything
                in between that connects them, are all fields of fascination. He
                will want to talk with you about them longer than you will want
                to talk. As much as that sounds abstract, Connor has the urge to
                get hands-on and apply the precious time of his life to confront
                systemic challenges head-on. He has been devoted since a young
                age to the arts and crafts of digital technology, but is also
                aware that tech isn't a silver bullet. Connor has fun with
                everything from getting deep in the code, to working
                face-to-face facilitating at hackathons, workshops, classrooms,
                and client meetings.
