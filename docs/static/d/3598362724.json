Love. Food. Still, the production and consumption of food in our world is a source of massive issues and inequalities.

There is no such thing as waste, only resources in the wrong place. The Earth is a closed-loop system meaning there is no 'somewhere else', and for that reason it is imperative that we adopt the workings of a 'circular economy'. We aim to support initiatives that accelerate the transition to zero-waste economies, whether through bulk buying strategies, cutting out single-use plastics, or otherwise."}]},"allPortfolioCsv":{"nodes":[{"id":"e8a5a4d2-6db3-5222-b3c8-2ea7acf71ffc","project":"Acorn","deliverable":"MacOS and Linux App","link":"https://github.com/h-be/acorn-docs"},{"id":"756e2364-1f62-5014-a82b-bbdb4c4e5718","project":"Red Cat Bakery","deliverable":"E-commerce Website","link":"https://redcatbakery.com"},{"id":"fb01177b-4b72-5770-95fc-25aff273c9ac","project":"Fouladi Projects","deliverable":"E-commerce Website","link":"https://fouladiprojects.com"},{"id":"fdecc058-46f8-56fa-8667-d3bfaafaddfc","project":"Online Writing Workshop","deliverable":"Marketing Website","link":"https://sff.onlinewritingworkshop.com"}]}}}
